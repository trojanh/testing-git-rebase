  "readme": "Smoke-and-mirrors\n=================\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/smoke-and-mirrors.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/smoke-and-mirrors)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors)\n[![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/smoke-and-mirrors.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/smoke-and-mirrors)\n\n`Smoke-and-mirrors` is an `ember-addon` that focuses on improving initial and re-render performance in high-stress\nsituations by providing components and primitives for performant lists and `svelte renders` to match a core belief:\n**Don't render the universe, render the scene.**\n\n#### TL;DR svelte render: the fewer things you need to render, the faster your renders will be.\n\nYour web page is a universe, your viewport is the scene. Much like you wouldn't expect a video game to render\nout-of-scene content, your application should smartly cull the content it doesn't need to care about.  Trimming\nexcess content let's the browser perform both initial renders and re-renders at far higher frame-rates, as the only\ncontent it needs to focus on for layout is the content the user can see.\n\n`Smoke-and-mirrors` augments your existing app, it doesn't ask you to rewrite layouts or logic in order to use it.\nIt will try it's best to allow you to keep the conventions, structures, and layouts you want.\n\n\n\n## Support, Questions, Collaboration\n\nJoin the [smoke-and-mirrors](https://embercommunity.slack.com/messages/smoke-and-mirrors/) channel on Slack.\n\n[![Slack Status](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/)\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n### Infinite Scroll (bi-directional)\n\nInfinite scroll that remains performant even for very long lists is easily achievable \nwith the [`vertical-collection`](http://runspired.github.io/smoke-and-mirrors/#/available-components/vertical-collection).\nIt works via a scrollable div or scrollable body.\n\n - [bi-directional scrollable div](http://runspired.github.io/smoke-and-mirrors/#/examples/infinite-scroll)\n - [scrollable body](http://runspired.github.io/smoke-and-mirrors/#/examples/scrollable-body)\n - [dynamic content sizes](http://runspired.github.io/smoke-and-mirrors/#/examples/flexible-layout)\n - [as a table](http://runspired.github.io/smoke-and-mirrors/#/examples/dbmon)\n\n#### Horizontal Scrolling\n\nAll of the above demos work horizontally as well via the `horizontal-collection`.\n\n#### Grid Scrolling\n\nAll of the above demos (both horizontal and vertical) work as well via\n\n - `grid-collection`\n - `horizontal-grid`\n - `vertical-grid`\n\n### Svelte Anything\n\nUnder the hood, smoke-and-mirrors is using a powerful scroll-tracking abstraction for each of the components above.\n That abstraction is made available as a service.\n\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n`smoke-and-mirrors` is dependent on and installs `ember-run-raf`, which helps you budget and schedule the work in your\napp more intelligently.\n\n\n\n## Status\n\n[Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors)\n[![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors.svg)](https://david-dm.org/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors)\n[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors#info=devDependencies)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/runspired/smoke-and-mirrors?branch=master)\n\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor updated documentation, announcements, and demos running the latest release please \nvisit [http://runspired.github.io/smoke-and-mirrors/](http://runspired.github.io/smoke-and-mirrors/)\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\n - Open an Issue for discussion first if you're unsure a feature/fix is wanted.\n - Branch off of `develop` (default branch)\n - Use descriptive branch names (e.g. `<type>/<short-description>`)\n - Use [Angular Style Commits](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/v1.4.8/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)\n - PR against `develop` (default branch).\n\n### Commmits \n\nAngular Style commit messages have the full form:\n \n ```\n <type>(<scope>): <title>\n \n <body>\n \n <footer>\n ```\n \n But the abbreviated form (below) is acceptable and often preferred.\n \n ```\n <type>(<scope>): <title>\n ```\n \n Examples:\n \n - chore(deps): bump deps in package.json and bower.json\n - docs(component): document the `fast-action` component\n\n\n\n## Funding\n\nOSS is often a labor of love. Smoke And Mirrors is largely built with that love.\n\n<a href='https://pledgie.com/campaigns/30822'><img alt='Click here to lend your support to: Smoke-and-mirrors: Ambitious infinite-scroll and svelte rendering for Ember applications and make a donation at pledgie.com !' src='https://pledgie.com/campaigns/30822.png?skin_name=chrome' border='0' ></a>\n",
