# ember-cli-cordova [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/poetic/ember-cli-cordova.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/poetic/ember-cli-cordova) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/poetic/ember-cli-cordova.svg)](https://gitter.im/poetic/ember-cli-cordova?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

I will not be focusing on backward compatibility with older ember-cli versions
as it's moving too fast and the API is constantly changing. I will always have
this working with the latest stable release of ember-cli.

## Goals

To provide a toolchain tightly integrated with ember-cli to make developing hybrid
apps with cordova and ember as simple as possible.

## Supported Platforms

Android and iOS. While we don't plan on actively supporting other platforms,
feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Required Ember Versions

Releases as of 0.1.0 require Ember 2.x and ember-cli 2.3.0.

The lastest release for Ember 1.x is 0.0.19 and requires at least ember-cli >= 0.1.1

## Getting Started

Please see our Getting Started guide
[here](https://github.com/poetic/ember-cli-cordova/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)

## Blueprints
+ `ember g cordova-init com.reverse.domain --platform=android` Required generator
  that sets up the cordova project with a few tweaks to the ember app
+ (optional) `ember g cordova-starter-kit` Adds some packages and files that makes up the
  base setup for projects I develop.

## Commands
+ `ember cordova:open` open xcode project
+ `ember cordova:build --environment=production --platform=ios` build cordova project
+ `ember cordova:archive 0.0.2 --environment=staging --commit --tag` archive ios project with xcode
+ `ember cordova:prepare` needs to be run after cloning a project
+ `ember cordova` Passes commands(plugin(s), platform(s), run, emulate) and arguments to the cordova command
+ `ember help` ember cli help with a section for addon provided commands as well

# ember-cordova

[ember-cordova](https://github.com/isleofcode/ember-cordova) recently started as a fork of ember-cli-cordova by some
contributors and maintainers. It only supports Ember 2, and includes
added features such as build hooks, native splash screen & icon management,
a platform service (e.g. isIOS) and an ember/cordova plugin ecosystem.

ember-cli-cordova will still be maintained and active.

It does not include features such as mobiletouch by default, starter
blueprints and support for Ember <2. For these items, your best bet is
to continue with ember-cli-cordova.

# Contributing

## Working with master

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/poetic/ember-cli-cordova.git
cd ember-cli-cordova
npm i && bower i
npm link
ember new CordovaTest
cd CordovaTest
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-cordova
npm link ember-cli-cordova
```

After this, any changes you make to the cloned repo will be instantly reflected
in the test app you generated. It just symlinks the node_modules folder.
